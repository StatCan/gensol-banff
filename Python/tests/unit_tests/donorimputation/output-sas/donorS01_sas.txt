WARNING: There were 1 observations dropped from DATA data set because one/more EDITS 
         variables or one/more MUSTMATCH variables outside the EDITS group are negative 
         in DATA data set and there is no corresponding FTI in INSTATUS data set.
NOTE: There were 1 observations dropped from DATA data set because they are potential 
      donors but toexcl value is 'E' for these observations.
