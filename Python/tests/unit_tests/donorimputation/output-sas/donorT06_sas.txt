WARNING: There were 2 observations dropped from DATA data set because one/more EDITS 
         variables or one/more MUSTMATCH variables outside the EDITS group are missing in 
         DATA data set and there is no corresponding FTI in INSTATUS data set.
WARNING: There were 3 observations dropped from DATA data set because one/more EDITS 
         variables or one/more MUSTMATCH variables outside the EDITS group are negative 
         in DATA data set and there is no corresponding FTI in INSTATUS data set.
WARNING: There were 2 mixed observations dropped from DATA data set because one or more
